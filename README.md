- Carousels with about 80 images and 10 videos

- Google Maps and Calendar embeds

- Contact form with extra details option

- Menu picker for Light, Dark and System color themes.

- I have also set up a sort of _Easter egg_ for the client who loves guitar: An underlined title that is grabbed by the mouse pointer and once "released" or "plucked" two different harp sounds play (which are a major third interval).
